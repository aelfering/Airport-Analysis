# Airport-Analysis

This contains analysis that I do for fun to examine airport operations. Data accessed can be found using the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

**Projects Include**
- [PDF scrapping passenger stats from Athens International Airport](https://github.com/aelfering/Airport-Analysis/tree/master/Athens%20PDF%20Scrape) 
- [Building a waterfall chart using passenger stats from San Francisco International Airport](https://github.com/aelfering/Airport-Analysis/tree/master/San%20Francisco%20Airport)
- [Calculating airport delays per 50 departures by airport](https://github.com/aelfering/Airport-Analysis/blob/master/DelaysPer50/DelaysPer50.R)
